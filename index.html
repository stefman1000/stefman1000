    <h2>Connecting perceptions of Crime in chicago to actual crime in chicago, and related net migration outflows</h2>

    <p>
      Chicago is often hampered by the reputation of being a den of crime and misery, a reputation for being on the most dangerous cities in the world despite not 
      even cracking the top <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-city-rankings/most-violent-cities-in-america">20 most dangerous cities in the US</a> . In this project I sought to answer both whether the perception of Chicago as being crime ridden has a basis in reality
      and whether that perception was contributing to Chicago's net migration outflow over the past few decades

    <div> <p>The differences in crime numbers from the dawn of the century to current day is incredible. Even with the spike in crime that happened during Covid,
      the numbers are clearly going down. So is there any truth to perceptions that crime is on the rise? A little bit, while violent crime on a whole is treding down, there is a distinct 
      uptrend is homicide and shooting crimes. This trend is not unique to Chicago, but it does perhaps explain why Chicago crime is so sensationalized. Normal violent crimes like robberies don't 
      capture peoples' attention the same way gang shootings or homicides do.

<p>While the absolute number of crimes is still faling, the proportion of gun crimes continues to increase. Thus in one sense Chicago has become slightly less safe becasue while one would be less likely 
  to be a victim of crime, there is a higher chance for the criminal to be using a firearm which would make the encounter more dangerous. But there is also the caveat that much crime in Chicago is localized to particular neighborhoods, 
  and targeted. While this does make Chicago as a whole less safe, it still means the chance of running into an armed criminal is lower than the data would suggest for most of the population.

<p> People generally leave an area for one of two reasons, cost of living or fears over safety. As both crime and housing cost went down in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis,
  Chicago's net outflows of people (purely who is moving in or out, not deaths and births) briefly decreased. Yet crime has been consistantly going down over the past decade,
  although the rate of that decrease plateaued around 2014. Meanwhile the net migrant outflow only increased when housing prices were going down and crime was going down, which is 
  completely against what we'd expect to happen when crime and cost of living fall which is more people moving in. There can't be a real disconnect between the facts and perceptions of housing costs, which is concrete. 
  So the misconcepntions which is causing Chicago to lose people is the perception of high crime, fueled by sensationalized media.

  <h1>Number of Fox news articles about city per million people</h1>

<p>While I didn't read every single article which would have clarified whether these were positive or negative articles, since it's Fox I think it's fair to say they are almost all negative.
  All else being equal, we would expect the number of articles written about a city by a national news organization to be propotional to the number of people living there.
  There are exceptions, like when the national news org is based there like the New York Times, but beyond that writing more about a certain city is indicative of a certain bias to or against said city. Since Fox certainly doesn't secretly carry a torch for Chicago,
  it's fair to say they have a major axe to grind with the city. While some machine learning to actually demonstrate malice from Fox News towards Chicago would be ideal, without that
  just by the sheer volume Fox and similar news orgs write about Chicago crime it creates and inflated perception of crime. After all, hearing a report on how many shootings there were over a weekend
  creates a far more lasting impression than the eventual news release that violent crime is once again down in Chicago. If all you read was Fox you would probably be inclined to distrust the government for even saying crime were trending down</p>
